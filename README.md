## Image Caption Generator

## Abstract

This model generates textual description from an image based on the objects and actions in the image.

This project addresses the problem by using a deep neural network model. The model would make use of Convolution neural networks to read image data and Recurrent neural networks for learning captions for image.

It requires both methods from computer vision to understand the content of the image and a language model from the field of natural language processing to turn the understanding of the image into words in the right order.

## Output Examples

![](/img/children.png "")

![](/img/bull.png "")

![](/img/dog.png "")
